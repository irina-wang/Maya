#### About

I got really interested about Autodesk Maya after engaging in the [Women In Animation](https://womeninanimation.org/) discussion circle. As part of [ASWF summer learning program](https://www.aswf.io/blog/introducing-aswf-diversity-and-inclusion-summer-learning-program/), I completed [Intro to Maya 3 for Maya](https://www.udemy.com/course/intro-to-python-3-for-maya-2022/), and I'm currently half way through [Maya for Absolute Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/intro-to-python-3-for-maya-2022/). 

This is the repository that I used to document my learning jounrney for Maya starting 2022 summer. I'm learning currently working on a camera plugin.
